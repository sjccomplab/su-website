# Static Web

A very cool website.

## Technology
		
This project uses pug instead of html, less instead of css. And used gulp to translate the files back to html and css. The generated html files can be directly opened by the browser. 

## Installation

Requires Node.js and npm

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

Then view by opening the .html files in the docs folder.

*** Do NOT edit the files in the docs folder, it would be overwritten whenever you run the build command.
